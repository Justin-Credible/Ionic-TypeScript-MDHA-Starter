## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to show a native Toast (a little text popup) on iOS, Android and WP8.
It's great for showing a non intrusive native notification which is guaranteed always in the viewport of the browser.
* You can choose where to show the Toast: at the top, center or bottom of the screen.
* You can choose two durations: short (approx. 2 seconds), or long (approx. 5 seconds), after which the Toast automatically disappears.
* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).
* Officially supported by [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins).
* Minimum iOS version is [6](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin/issues/7).

Example usages:
* "There were validation errors"
* "Account created successfully"
* "The record was deleted"
* "Login successful"
* "The battery is almost dead"
* "You are now logged out"
* "Connection failure, please try again later"

## 3. Installation

### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)
Toast is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI (backup your project first!):

Using the Cordova CLI and the [Cordova Plugin Registry](http://plugins.cordova.io)
```
$ cordova plugin add nl.x-services.plugins.toast
$ cordova prepare
```

Or using the phonegap CLI
```
$ phonegap local plugin add nl.x-services.plugins.toast
```

Toast.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

### Manually

1\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml` in the root directory of your `www` folder:
```xml
<!-- for iOS -->
<feature name="Toast">
  <param name="ios-package" value="Toast" />
</feature>
```
```xml
<!-- for Android -->
<feature name="Toast">
  <param name="android-package" value="nl.xservices.plugins.Toast" />
</feature>
```
```xml
<!-- for WP8 -->
<feature name="Toast">
  <param name="wp-package" value="Toast"/>
</feature>
```

For iOS, you'll need to add the `QuartzCore.framework` to your project (it's for automatically removing the Toast after a few seconds).
Click your project, Build Phases, Link Binary With Libraries, search for and add `QuartzCore.framework`.

2\. Grab a copy of Toast.js, add it to your project and reference it in `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/Toast.js"></script>
```

3\. Download the source files and copy them to your project.

iOS: Copy the two `.h` and two `.m` files to `platforms/ios/<ProjectName>/Plugins`

Android: Copy `Toast.java` to `platforms/android/src/nl/xservices/plugins` (create the folders)

WP8: Copy `Toast.cs` to `platforms/wp8/Plugins/nl.x-services.plugins.toast` (create the folders)

### PhoneGap Build

Toast works with PhoneGap build too, but only with PhoneGap 3.0 and up.

Just add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.toast" source="plugins.cordova.io" />
```
or to use a specific version:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.toast" source="plugins.cordova.io" version="2.0.6" />
```

Toast.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

## 4. Usage

### Showing a Toast
You have two choices to make when showing a Toast: where to show it and for how long.
* show(message, duration, position)
* duration: 'short', 'long'
* position: 'top', 'center', 'bottom'

You can also use any of these convenience methods:
* showShortTop(message)
* showShortCenter(message)
* showShortBottom(message)
* showLongTop(message)
* showLongCenter(message)
* showLongBottom(message)

You can copy-paste these lines of code for a quick test:
```html
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.showShortTop('Hello there!', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast showShortTop</button>
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.showLongBottom('Hello there!', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast showLongBottom</button>
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.show('Hello there!', 'long', 'center', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast show long center</button>
```

#### Tweaking the vertical position
Since 2.1.0 you can add pixels to move the toast up or down.
Note that `showWithOptions` can be used instead of the functions above, but it's not useful unless you want to pass `addPixelsY`.
```js
function showTop() {
  window.plugins.toast.showWithOptions(
    {
      message: "hey there",
      duration: "short",
      position: "bottom",
      addPixelsY: -40  // added a negative value to move it up a bit (default 0)
    },
    onSuccess, // optional
    onError    // optional
  );
}
```

### Hiding a Toast
In case you want to hide a Toast manually, call this:
```js
function hide() {
  // this function takes an optional success callback, but you can do without just as well
  window.plugins.toast.hide();
}
```

### WP8 quircks
The WP8 implementation needs a little more work, but it's perfectly useable when you keep this in mind:
* You can't show two Toasts simultaneously.
* Wait until the first Toast is hidden before the second is shown, otherwise the second one will be hidden quickly.
* The positioning of the bottom-aligned Toast is not perfect, but keep it down to 1 or 2 lines of text and you're fine.
